## System Components

### 1. **Frontend**
The frontend serves as the user interface for SolvAI users. It includes:
- **Web Interface**: The primary point of access for users to explore features, interact with AI, and manage their investments.
- **Telegram Mini-App**: A lightweight, easy-to-access platform for users to chat with SolvAI's AI agent, search ICOs, and find yield farming opportunities.

### 2. **Backend**
The backend is the brain of the SolvAI platform. It manages:
- **API Integrations**: Communicates with external APIs like OpenAI, Coinbase, CoinGecko, and Ethereum.
- **AI Processing**: Handles AI-powered insights and recommendations using OpenAI models.
- **Data Management**: Stores and retrieves user preferences, investment data, and real-time market information.

### 3. **Database**
SolvAI uses a robust database system to:
- Store user profiles, investment preferences, and activity logs.
- Cache frequently accessed data, such as market trends, to optimize performance.

### 4. **Third-Party APIs**
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the AI-driven agent for answering user queries and generating insights.
- **Coinbase API**: Provides exchange rate data and facilitates crypto-related operations.
- **CoinGecko API**: Supplies real-time market data for ICOs and yield farming opportunities.
- **Ethereum API**: Integrates blockchain functionality for token management and transactions.

### 5. **Token System**
SolvAIâ€™s native token, $SOLVAI, integrates seamlessly with the Ethereum blockchain. It powers key functionalities, including staking, rewards, and premium feature access.
