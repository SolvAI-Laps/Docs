# Data Flow and Storage

This document provides an overview of how data flows through the SolvAI platform and the methods used for secure data storage.

---

## Data Flow

### 1. **User Interaction**
- Users access SolvAI through:
  - **Web Interface**: Directly interacts with SolvAI’s features, such as finding ICOs or using the AI agent.
  - **Telegram Mini-App**: Provides a simplified interface to interact with the AI agent and access investment opportunities.

### 2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**
- All user interactions from the web interface or Telegram app are transmitted to the backend via secure HTTPS connections.
- Data is validated at the frontend before being sent to the backend to minimize security risks.

### 3. **Backend Processing**
- The backend processes user requests by:
  - Querying third-party APIs (OpenAI, Coinbase, CoinGecko, Ethereum) for relevant data.
  - Running AI models and algorithms to generate insights and recommendations.
- Processes and results are logged for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

### 4. **Data Retrieval from Third-Party APIs**
- SolvAI relies on external APIs to retrieve:
  - Market data from CoinGecko and Coinbase.
  - AI-generated responses from OpenAI.
  - Blockchain transaction details from Ethereum APIs.
- All API requests and responses are logged to ensure transparency and traceability.

### 5. **Response to Users**
- Processed data and insights are sent back to users through:
  - The web interface (displayed in real-time).
  - The Telegram mini-app (via chat messages or interactive buttons).

## Data Storage

### 1. **Database**
- **Type**: Relational database for structured data, such as user profiles and activity logs.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption ensures sensitive data is protected.
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions to restrict access to sensitive information.

### 2. **Cache**
- Frequently accessed data (e.g., popular ICOs, market trends) is stored in a caching system to improve performance.
- Cached data is updated periodically to ensure accuracy.

### 3. **Blockchain Data**
- On-chain data, such as transactions involving $SOLVAI tokens, is stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
- SolvAI retrieves this data via Ethereum API calls for analytics and reporting.

### 4. **Logs**
- **System Logs**: Capture backend processes, API interactions, and errors for debugging.
- **Access Logs**: Record user activities to detect anomalies and ensure compliance.
- **Retention Period**: Logs are retained for 90 days unless required for legal or compliance purposes.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

### 1. **User Data**
- Minimal data collection to respect user privacy.
- Personal data is anonymized whenever possible.

### 2. **Compliance**
- Adherence to regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
- Regular audits to ensure compliance with privacy laws.

### 3. **Data Deletion**
- Users can request data deletion through the support team.
- Deleted data is permanently removed from all storage systems within 30 days.
